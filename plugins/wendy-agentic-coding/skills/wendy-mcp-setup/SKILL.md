# Wendy MCP Setup Workflow

Use this when a developer wants AI assistants to access Wendy device tools through the Wendy CLI MCP server.

## Preconditions

Verify the CLI first:

```bash
wendy --version
wendy --json info
```

If the MCP server should connect to a device on startup, either set a default device or use `--device` when launching the server:

```bash
wendy discover --json --timeout 5s
wendy device set-default <hostname>
```

## Automatic setup

Run this only when the user wants Wendy MCP written into local AI tool configuration:

```bash
wendy mcp setup
```

Current setup behavior configures Claude Code and Claude Desktop when detected. It writes a stdio MCP server entry that runs the installed `wendy` binary with:

```bash
wendy mcp serve
```

After setup, restart or reload the target AI tool so it discovers the new MCP server.

## Manual server command

The MCP server is stdio-based and is normally launched by an MCP host:

```bash
wendy mcp serve
wendy mcp serve --device <hostname>
```

`--device` can also be written as `-d`. If omitted, the server attempts to use the configured default device.

For Codex or any MCP host not covered by `wendy mcp setup`, configure a stdio server named `wendy` with command `wendy` and args `["mcp", "serve"]`. Add `--device <hostname>` only when the user wants that MCP server pinned to one device.

## Verification

Before blaming MCP, verify device access directly with `wendy-device-ops`:

```bash
wendy --json device version --device <hostname>
wendy --json hardware list --device <hostname>
```

If `wendy mcp serve` logs a warning that it could not connect to a device, set a default device or configure the MCP host to launch `wendy mcp serve --device <hostname>`.

## Safety

MCP exposes operational device tools to the assistant host. Do not configure it silently. Tell the user what local config file was changed when the CLI reports it, and do not copy tokens, WiFi passwords, or device-specific secrets into reusable docs or issue text.
